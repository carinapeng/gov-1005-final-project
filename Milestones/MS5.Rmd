For this week's milestone:

- Lucy created a new rmd called cleaning. The code takes in the google form responses and cleans the data
- Angie suggested changes to last year's graph (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LfByzzE7a8JRQvC_CxbF1MAalwh7yRcetwZ0kZGxWuw/edit?usp=sharing) that we will be using to guide our data visualization for the final project
- Shojeh and Eliot added more information to the shiny app and its navigation features.
- Sam collected athletic information 
- Jamal made edits to the google survey for data validation.
- Carina and Ilyas designed a pubbing plan to collect responses.
